# Django Image Compression Project

This project is a Django-based application that compresses uploaded images into three different sizes:
- `thumbnail_small`: 100x100 pixels
- `thumbnail_medium`: 500x500 pixels
- `thumbnail_large`: 800x800 pixels

## Features
- Upload images and automatically generate three compressed versions of each image.
- Images are stored and resized on the server.
- Simple and clean interface for uploading images.
-  PostgreSQL database for storing image information.
